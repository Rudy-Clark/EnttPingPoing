# Ping Pong ECS
Simple Ping Pong game created using Raylib and Entt libraries.

## Install
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Rudy-Clark/EnttPingPoing.git
```
And open with Visual Studio 2022. Also vcpkg package manager must be installed on your system. I'm using vcpkg.exe to include third party libraries like entt, raylib.
